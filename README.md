# BRender-3DMM
 The version of the Argonaut Blazing Render (BRender) library used in 3D Movie Maker.

 When BRender was open sourced, it was assumed one of the versions released would match the one in 3D Movie Maker, or that 3D Movie Maker contained a with-source copy of the BRender SDK in the repo. This turned out not to be true, and so this is a release of the BRender library as originally used by 3D Movie Maker.

 This version dates to approximately May 1995. 


# Files

Only the fixed point z-buffer version is included, compiled for Microsoft Visual C++ 2.1.
